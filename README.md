# rblscan
Command line script to scan RBLs to see if an IP is blacklisted.

Built for ISP's, Network Admins, etc. I'll add more blocklists as I need them. If you need me to add one for you, let me know.

How to use:

1. git clone https://github.com/rblanchardbell/rblscan
2. cd rblscan
3. chmod a+x rblscan
4. ./rblscan <ip address>
 
Enjoy!
